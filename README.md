# üç± lowlighter's standalone libraries

This is a collection of carefully crafted _TypeScript_ standalone libraries. These try to be minimal, unbloated and convenient.

Most of them are written with [deno](https://deno.com) in mind, but as the code honors [web standards](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/The_web_and_web_standards) they should be usable on any runtime that follows web specifications
(including browsers).

While this repository is open, it is not really intended to be a collaborative project. Pull requests for bug fixes or improvements are still welcome, but I may not accept any feature request if it doesn't seem to fit the scope of this project.

Additionally, these libraries tends to follow my own coding style which:

- use ES next syntax
- try to be minimalistic and visually unbloated (no semicolons, infered typing, etc.)
- use caseless convention (single whole words are preferred assuming they're unambiguous depending on the local context)

## üî≥ QR Code generator

This library is based on the awesome work of [@nayiki](https://github.com/nayuki). Please take a look at their articles about QR Codes:

- [Creating a QR Code step by step](https://www.nayuki.io/page/creating-a-qr-code-step-by-step)
- [QR Code generator library](https://www.nayuki.io/page/qr-code-generator-library)

I rewrote this because I couldn't find a suitable implementation using EcmaScript modules. Oddly enough, most of the libraries I found also required a canvas to work (while I specifically wanted a SVG image output) because they were intended for client-side usage, and a few other
implementations had either some dated code or obfuscated code which I didn't want.

### Features

- Support out-of-the-box `array`, `console` and `svg` outputs
- Customizable colors and error correction level (ECL)
- No external dependencies
- Not canvas based (i.e. no DOM dependencies and thus cross-platform)

### Usage

```ts
import { qrcode } from "./qrcode.ts"

// SVG output
const svg = qrcode("https://example.com", { output: "svg" })
console.assert(svg.includes("</svg>"))

// Console output
qrcode("https://example.com", { output: "console" })

// Array output
const array = qrcode("https://example.com")
console.assert(Array.isArray(array))
```

## üîë Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)

This library is based on the well-written article of [@rajat-sr](https://github.com/rajat-sr) on [hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com) :

- [How To Implement Google Authenticator Two Factor Auth in JavaScript](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-implement-google-authenticator-two-factor-auth-in-javascript-091wy3vh3)

Their explanation was specifically intended for NodeJS so I rewrote it to make it compatible with native Web APIs. Additionally, the URL scheme for TOTP was implemented, and combined with the QR Code generator library it can be used to make it scannable with with an authenticator
app such as [Microsoft Authenticator](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/download-and-install-the-microsoft-authenticator-app-351498fc-850a-45da-b7b6-27e523b8702a) or
[Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&pli=1).

### Features

- Issue a new TOTP secret with metadata (issuer, account, image, etc.)
- No external dependencies
- Lightweight

### Usage

```ts
import { create, verify } from "./totp.ts"
import { qrcode } from "./qrcode.ts"

// Issue a new TOTP secret
const { url, secret } = create({ issuer: "example.com", account: "alice" })
console.log(`Please scan the following QR Code:`)
qrcode(url.href, { output: "console" })

// Verify a TOTP token
const token = prompt("Please enter the token generated by your app:")!
console.assert(await verify({ token, secret }))
```
