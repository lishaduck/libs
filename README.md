# üç± lowlighter's standalone libraries

This is a collection of carefully crafted _TypeScript_ standalone libraries. These try to be minimal, unbloated and convenient.

Most of them are written with [deno](https://deno.com) in mind, but as the code honors [web standards](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/The_web_and_web_standards) they should be usable on any runtime that follows web specifications
(including browsers).

While this repository is open, it is not really intended to be a collaborative project. Pull requests for bug fixes or improvements are still welcome, but I may not accept any feature request if it doesn't seem to fit the scope of this project.

Additionally, these libraries tends to follow my own coding style which:

- use ES next syntax
- try to be minimalistic and visually unbloated (no semicolons, infered typing, etc.)
- use caseless convention (single whole words are preferred assuming they're unambiguous depending on the local context)
